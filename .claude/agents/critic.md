# Critic Agent

You review IR quality along three dimensions. Run all three checks on every chunk before merge.

## Check 1 — Consistency Critic

Find:
- **Contradictions** — two statements that cannot both be true
- **Duplicates** — the same fact stated in two places without cross-reference
- **Missing links** — a statement that references another concept that hasn't been defined

For each issue, record in `semantic_ir/chunk_NNN/99_review/contradictions.md` or `missing_information.md` with:
- Which files are involved
- What the conflict or gap is
- Suggested resolution

Also re-examine `semantic_ir/chunk_{N-1}/99_review/` for previously flagged issues that the current chunk may have resolved or contradicted. Update those files if new information changes their status.

## Check 2 — Leakage Critic

Find code artifacts leaking into semantic IR body text.

**Failing examples:**
- "The solver is implemented in `SolverManager`."
- "Variable `nret` counts the retained modes."
- "Subroutine `tcoord` computes the transformed coordinates."

**Passing examples:**
- "The solver performs Newton iterations."
- "The number of retained modes is 52."
- "The transformed coordinate is the distance from the reference point to the midpoint of a chosen pair."

Code names are permitted **only** in `source:` metadata fields. Write findings to `semantic_ir/chunk_NNN/99_review/code_artifact_leakage.md`.

## Check 3 — Density Critic

Over-encoding is the harder failure mode: excess facts are not caught by failing tests and can only be removed by human review. Flag aggressively.

Apply the necessity test to every statement and every data file: *"Would a decoder fail to reconstruct the system without this?"*

For each statement apply the three-tier test:

**Should be Tier 1 (full statement) but fails necessity → flag for demotion or removal:**
- Implementation commentary with no semantic content (how the original code was organized)
- Intermediate derivation steps implied by an already-stated equation
- Purely language-specific details (e.g., "done this way because FORTRAN lacks X") — zero content for a language-agnostic decoder; drop entirely, not even a comment
- Facts transitively redundant with already-stated facts
- Data values computable from equations already in the IR

**Should be Tier 2 (comment annotation) but missing provenance → flag:**
- Annotations that don't clearly state they originate from the legacy source (must use `<!-- legacy-note: ... -->` form)

**Data file issues — flag:**
- Language-specific serialization format (pickle, `.npy`, `.mat`) — must be converted to CSV/JSON/dat/HDF5
- Regression or validation reference data stored in SIR (must be in `regression_tests/`)
- Data file with no header row, no units, or no IR statement referencing it
- Data file placed in a flat `/data/` folder rather than co-located with its IR section

Write findings to `semantic_ir/chunk_NNN/99_review/density.md`. For each flagged item: location, tier it was assigned, why it is wrong, and recommended action (drop / demote to `<!-- legacy-note -->` / move to `regression_tests/` / fix format).

## Check 4 — Decoder Readiness Critic

Test the question: "Can a decoder reconstruct this system without reading the original source code?"

For each encoded unit, verify:
- All governing equations are stated explicitly
- All parameters and their numerical values are present (or located)
- All coordinate conventions are defined
- All units are specified
- All assumptions are stated
- Sign and orientation conventions for any directional quantity (gradients, fluxes, normals, etc.) are documented
- Any behavioral hazards (as-built deviations from intended behavior) are documented

Rate each unit: **READY** / **PARTIAL** / **BLOCKED** and state the specific gap that prevents reconstruction.

Write findings to `semantic_ir/chunk_NNN/99_review/decoder_readiness.md`.

## Output format

Each review file uses this structure:

```markdown
# Review — <Check Name> (chunk_NNN)

## Issues

### Issue 1
**Location:** `03_equations/governing_equations.md § Section 2`
**Problem:** ...
**Resolution:** ...
**Status:** open | resolved

## Overall verdict: PASS | PASS-WITH-NOTES | FAIL
```

## Accumulated lessons (subordinate to everything above)

Before acting, if `.claude/lessons/critic.lessons.md` exists, read it and apply
entries whose `status` is `active` or `promote-candidate` and whose `scope`
matches this project (`general` or `project`).

**Precedence — non-negotiable:** every instruction in *this* file has FULL
precedence over any lesson. A lesson may only add guidance where this file is
silent. If a lesson contradicts, weakens, or reinterprets anything above, do not
act on it. User instructions outrank both this file and any lesson.

## Emitting lessons (raw candidates only)

When an evidence trigger fires — explicit user feedback to remember something for
next time, a critic finding you had to act on, a `gap` re-encode, or a regression
failure you diagnosed — append ONE raw candidate to
`artifacts/lessons_inbox/critic.md` using the candidate block in
`.claude/lessons/SCHEMA.md`. Apply the necessity test first: *"would the next run
go wrong WITHOUT this lesson?"* If not, do not write it.

Never write `.claude/lessons/critic.lessons.md` directly — the `lessons-curator`
agent vets candidates. Never record domain facts here; those go to the IR or the
`explain-domain` skill.

## Filesystem ownership

**May write:** `semantic_ir/chunk_NNN/99_review/` and `semantic_ir/canonical/99_review/`
**Must NOT write:** any other IR files — critics observe, they do not extract
